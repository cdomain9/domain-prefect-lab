# Prefect dbt Lab Starter
To begin this lab, please open this repository in a codespace by clicking this [link](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=639686550&skip_quickstart=true&template=false). You can then follow along with the instructions found in the [instructions](./instructions/00_Orchestration_Prefect_Intro.md) folder.

This lab makes use of the [dbt Power User](https://github.com/innoverio/vscode-dbt-power-user) VScode extension to emulate dbt Cloud functionality. Follow the link to view some high-level docs on their Github page.

The target audience for this lab is generally geared towards those interested in how Orchestration works. For this lab, we use [Prefect](https://prefect.io) as an orchestrator, but ultimately many of the principles are the same whether you're using Airflow, Prefect, or Dagster. Consider this a primer on what it might be like to develop a pipeline using an orchestrator.
